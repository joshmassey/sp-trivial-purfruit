### 1. Requirements for User Interfaces

The libraries needed to run user interfaces include:
- PIL
- tkinter
- pandas

- On the Main Menu window, users will have access to one of the three options below:
  - Start New Game
  - Access Database
  - Exit Trivial Purfruit (this button will shut down Main Menu and exit application)
- Start New Game Button
  - A new window titled TP Game Settings will pop up, this will allow users to enter settings for a new game.
  - Enter names of the players to join the game
  - Select a time limit for answering questions (for demo purposes only)

  - With the buttons at the bottom of the window, the user can either view rules of the game or begin new game
- Access Database Button
  - A new window titled Database Authentication will pop up, an authorized user must enter their username and password
    - For demo purposes, clicking Authenticate without any credentials will proceed to Question Database
  - When the user has entered their credentials, the user can click Authenticate to verify the credentials
  - If the credentials are verified, a new window will pop up allowing Database acccess and modification
  - A button in the Database Authentication window also allows for exit and return to the Main Menu
